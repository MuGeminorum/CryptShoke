CorridorDoor Animations

This Door fits the pieces with Doorways cut into the dungeon corridor pieces that have an arched door cut into the wall - 
not to be used with DOorDivides - they have their own doors


Door has 4 Animations and features Multitrack Animations in the formats Direct X and FBX which are prefixed
with an 'm'.
Engines like Unity, or other engines supporting multriack animations can take advantage of these formats, allowing
for the animation name to be used by name within the engine.

A much requested feature i see continually for dungeon styled kits, is that doors open both ways, so that in effect the
doors always open away from the player and not go through them, thus two opening styles are provided


Animations are also provided as single track for engines that do not support multitrack
